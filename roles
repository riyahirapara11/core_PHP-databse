If you're dealing with a **large and complex system**, it's essential to design a **flexible, scalable, and maintainable** RBAC system. As your system grows, you'll need to handle more roles, permissions, and more complex scenarios, which means the structure and management of your RBAC system will need to be more robust.

Here's how to approach it:

### 1. **Granular Roles and Permissions**
In a large system, you may have many different roles, each with very specific permissions. Instead of simply assigning broad roles like **admin** or **user**, you could define more specific roles such as:
- **Super Admin**: Has all permissions across the system.
- **Admin**: Can manage users, moderate content, etc.
- **Manager**: Manages specific resources like products or orders.
- **User**: Can access basic user-facing features.

### 2. **Use Multiple Tables for Better Flexibility**

You will need more tables to manage roles and permissions in a scalable manner. Here’s an updated table structure for a more complex system:

#### Table Structure:
- **users**: Stores user information.
- **roles**: Stores role information (e.g., Admin, User).
- **permissions**: Stores individual permissions (e.g., create_post, edit_user).
- **role_permissions**: A pivot table that links roles to the permissions they have.
- **user_roles**: A pivot table that links users to the roles they have.
- **permission_groups** (optional): If your permissions are grouped logically (e.g., user management permissions, content management permissions).

### Example Schema:

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    password VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT
);

-- Permissions table
CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT
);

-- Role-Permissions pivot table (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
    role_id INT,
    permission_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (role_id, permission_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (permission_id) REFERENCES permissions(id)
);

-- User-Roles pivot table (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    user_id INT,
    role_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id)
);
```

### 3. **Defining Permissions**
Permissions should be **action-based**, describing what the user can do in your system. For example:

- **create_user**
- **edit_user**
- **delete_user**
- **view_user**
- **create_post**
- **edit_post**
- **delete_post**

Each permission represents an action that can be assigned to a role, and roles are assigned to users.

### 4. **Role Hierarchy (Optional)**
For a large system, you might want to define a **role hierarchy**, where roles can inherit permissions from other roles. For example:
- **Super Admin** could inherit everything from **Admin** and **Manager** roles.
- **Manager** could inherit permissions from **User**.

This would reduce the need to manually assign each permission to each role, streamlining the process.

### 5. **Access Control Logic**
When a user tries to access a resource, your code will need to check if the user has the required permission. This check will involve the following:

1. Check if the user has a role that grants the required permission.
2. Check if the user has the specific permission directly assigned (if necessary).

You might use middleware or a service class to handle permission checks in your system.

### 6. **Consideration for Large Systems:**
   - **Caching**: With many roles and permissions, it’s important to cache role and permission data to reduce database queries.
   - **Audit Trail**: For security and compliance, maintain logs for permission changes, user role assignments, and other critical actions.
   - **Granular Permissions**: Break down permissions to be very specific (e.g., not just "edit" permission but "edit_product" or "edit_category") so that you can manage fine-grained access control.
   - **Dynamic Permissions**: If your application grows to include features that need permissions added on the fly, use a flexible system where you can add permissions and roles easily without major code changes.

### 7. **Example in Action**:

Let’s assume that you have **two roles**:
- **Admin**
- **User**

You’ll create corresponding entries in the **roles** table, then add **permissions** like **create_user**, **edit_user**, **delete_user**, **view_post**, etc.

#### Assigning Permissions to Roles:
```sql
-- Example for Admin role
INSERT INTO roles (name, description) VALUES ('Admin', 'Has full control over the system');
INSERT INTO permissions (name, description) VALUES ('create_user', 'Allows creating new users');
INSERT INTO permissions (name, description) VALUES ('edit_user', 'Allows editing users');
INSERT INTO permissions (name, description) VALUES ('delete_user', 'Allows deleting users');

-- Link Admin role to the permissions
INSERT INTO role_permissions (role_id, permission_id)
SELECT r.id, p.id
FROM roles r
JOIN permissions p ON p.name IN ('create_user', 'edit_user', 'delete_user')
WHERE r.name = 'Admin';
```

#### Assigning Roles to Users:
```sql
-- Assign Admin role to user
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id)
SELECT u.id, r.id
FROM users u
JOIN roles r ON r.name = 'Admin'
WHERE u.username = 'admin_user';
```

### Conclusion:
For a **large and complex system**, it is best practice to use **granular roles and permissions**, possibly with a **role hierarchy** for easier management. The schema can be extended with additional tables to accommodate more complex needs, but this gives you the foundation to handle complex scenarios in a scalable way.
